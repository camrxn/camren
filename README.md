## About me ðŸ’¬
As someone with extensive experience working with computers, I have recently started on the journey of learning coding. I find the field both new and challenging, which motivated me to enroll in this course at RCC. My background in technology has provided a solid foundation, and I am eager to deepen my understanding and skills in programming through this educational opportunity.
